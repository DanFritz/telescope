 "DION
 The violent carriage of it
 Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
 Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
 Shall the contents discover, something rare
 Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
 And gracious be the issue!"

 Winter's Tale, Act 3, Scene 1. William Shakespeare
